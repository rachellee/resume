Most of you don't know this, but I recently started volunteering at the Low Income Housing Institute doing their marketing and helping relaunch their website. This is an article I wrote about my experiences participating in One Night Count for their e-newsletter.<BR><BR>


It was 1am on January 22nd when I began changing into warm clothes, putting on layer after layer to ensure I wouldn’t be cold that night. This was my first time participating in the One Night Count, an annual event in King County where volunteers like me go out and count how many people are sleeping on the street from 2am to 5am. You get assigned either a portion of a neighborhood, or you ride the buses, counting how many people you see sleeping on the bus. The week before the Count, I had no idea an event like this existed. Here I was, a girl who had grown up in the Eastside, where homelessness is a mostly invisible issue, getting ready to go out and face the problem head on. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a little bit nervous.<BR><BR>

At about 2:30am, after some very necessary coffee, we broke up into small groups and, with our maps in hand, headed out the door. My partner was Mercedes, one of the Volunteer Programs Coordinators at LIHI.<BR><BR>

One, two. Right off the bat we saw a beat up van with its shades drawn. It only counts as two, but there could have been an entire family in there. As Mercedes and I counted, we chatted, and I learned an incredible amount about homelessness. For instance, it was not an arbitrary decision to have the Count end at 5am. Many of the people sleeping in the street have jobs, and at 5am they are waking up to begin their day. Often, people bus over to the Urban Rest Stop to shower and do laundry before they bus to their jobs, a process that probably takes hours.<BR><BR>

Three. I learned that the reason you see the same person in the same spot every night is because he or she knows that it is a safe spot for them to sleep at night, so they will go back to that spot.<BR><BR>

Four, five. I learned that in the first month individuals are elevated off the street and into a home they are elated, ecstatic. No surprise there. But during the second month they experience depression and some symptoms of PTSD. While on the streets, they are in fight or flight mode, never really having a moment to cope with what is happening to them. When they have a home and have alone time to think, they must face their demons in a whole new way. Sleep doesn’t save them from their thoughts either, as it often brings nightmares. It’s not just about survival anymore. It’s about healing.<BR><BR>

Six, seven, eight. The last people we counted were a group of three men. They were snuggled together in a doorway, trying to get what sleep they could despite the cold and the bright lights above them. Humans’ desire and ability to find people and connect remains true even when on the streets. They don’t have a house, but they created their own home. The nervousness I felt at the beginning of the night had quickly transformed into sadness and sorrow.<BR><BR>

When Mercedes and I were finished, we headed back to the meeting spot and waited for the others to get back. We had counted eight individuals. I thought this to be a very high number for our small section of Ballard until one group came back and reported seventeen. By 4:30am, all three groups had arrived back at our meeting spot, and all together, for our 0.08 square miles of land we counted 50 people sleeping in the streets or in their vehicles that night. For us, this was a mere 3 hours spent outside in the middle of the night. We had the luxury of a warm shelter to go back to. For those 50 people we counted, and the 3,722 others in King County, they did not have that luxury.<BR><BR>

There is still much to be done to end homelessness in Seattle, but what is important is that we continue to see it as an issue that has an end and share the importance and urgency of the issue with others. Encourage friends and family to volunteer and help out with the Count so that, even though it is at a very minor level, they can start to understand what it is like to be homeless. Share information and statistics with them about homelessness. Try to build empathy and understanding. Most of all, make sure that homelessness never becomes an invisible issue.<BR><BR>
