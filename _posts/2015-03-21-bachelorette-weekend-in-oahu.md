Here are some highlights from my future sister-in-law's bachelorette party in Oahu! These are the 10 things I would highly recommend doing/seeing/eating if you ever find yourself there :)<BR><BR>

1. Infinity Pool at the Sheraton

The next time in Waikiki I would probably spend the whole day here. Inifinity pool with amazing views, comfy chairs (perfect for tanning), and a bar. Yes please!

2. Snorkeling at Hanauma Bay

Then go to...<BR><BR>

3. Bubbie's for Mochi Ice Cream

They have all kinds of flavors: guava, lychee, passion fruit, chocolate, you name it!<BR><BR>

4. Leonard's for Malasadas

5. Marukame for Udon

Lines are long here, but don't be deterred! They move quickly and it's worth the wait. I would highly recommend the curry udon (pictured here).<BR><BR>


6. Polynesian Cultural Center Luau + Ha Breath of Life Show

Don't come here without seeing the show. It was a really fun, high production value show. I would also recommend getting here before the dinner so you can do things like go on a canoe ride.<BR><BR>

7. Laniakea Beach for tanning and SEA TURTLES!

On a nice day you can watch surfers, swim in the warm North Shore waters, or hang out with some sea turtles. This is a popular spot for sea turtles who like to just chill and nap on the beach! <br><br>

8. Matsumoto<BR>

Unfortunately I don't have a photo of the amazing shaved ice we have here, but it's a must if you're in the North Shore.<BR><BR>


9. Shirokiya

One step into Shirokiya and you'll find yourself asking if you're in Hawaii or Japan. It's a food court located in the Ala Moana Center in Waikiki. They have an incredible selection of authentic Japanese and Hawaiian cuisine. Ramen, Udon, Spam Musubi, Butter fish, you name it.<BR><BR>

10. Ono Seafood<BR>

Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to stop by this time, but it is seriously the best poke you will ever have.
