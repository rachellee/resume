title: New Year, New Beginnings
---

I’ve been trying to figure out what I want to blog about for almost a year now. I’ve started a few different blogs at different times and have been trying to figure out what to blog about for the past year. First it was tumblr inspos (who doesn’t love 2010’s Pinterest?), then it was gardening (I live for sustainable eating, succulents, and orchids), then it was food (I love trying new restaurants, recipes, and am an avid yelper - elite woot woot!). But I always found a reason to tell myself why I shouldn’t do it and none of those stuck.

This year’s going to be different.

This year, I have a clear vision of what I want to blog about and it’s not something I can talk myself out of due to my own unsureness. This year I’m getting my ish together and doing this regularly!

My new years resolution this year is to design on a regular basis and blog about it. I might include some other things, but the over arching theme will always be design. Industrial Design. Web Design. Print Design. Interior Design. Any and all of it.

Plus this is a good way to share my work with friends and family who are curious as to what I do every day, but this is mostly to keep myself in check and making sure I’m spending most of my time doing or thinking about design.

2015, I’m ready for ya.
