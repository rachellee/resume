In a move to have most of my favorite design, tech, and news blogs in one place, I hunted for the perfect iPhone app. <a href="http://newsify.co/">Newsify</a> comes pretty darn close. Upon opening the app what I was immediately drawn to was how clean the interface was. Then, I quickly realized how incredibly intuitive and easy to use this app was. There's a reason why this is the top news aggregator in the app store. The flow of the app is also amazing. The first time you open the app you're prompted to add your favorite sites. From then on the home screen is the compilation of that list in alphabetical order and at the very top are three folders. One for articles you star, one for the articles you haven't read yet, and a third for all articles. It's clear that a lot of thought and care was put into this app.

Like anything else, it is not perfect. There are some things I view as usability issues. For instance, when you scroll to the bottom of an article and you pull too far up, it will automatically take you to the next article and then to get back to the article you were originally a simple swipe left simply will not do. You have to press the back arrow, get back to the list of articles, tap on the article, and scroll back down to where you were before. For me, this is a huge downfall of the app. I am constantly having to go back to the article I was previously on as a result of pulling up too far. The app allows many customizable features. You can customize 

XXXXXXX YYYYYYYYY ZZZZZZZZ. You can customize left/right swipe. But you cannot remove the scrolling feature.

That particular usability feature is a huge downfall for me, but all in all this is still a beautiful, well-designed app with great usability, and it is definitely the best one out there.
