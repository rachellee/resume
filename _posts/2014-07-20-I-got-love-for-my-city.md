Seattle, Washington. The 206. The Rainy City. Coffee Capitol of the World. This is my city.

I love sharing with friends, families, strangers, the best places to eat, drink, and play in Seattle. Sharing the little treasures I've found in Seattle with others is something I really enjoy, and there are a lot of them. How much do I enjoy doing this? Well, I actually take pleasure in writing Yelp reviews and I recently made an extensive Google Spreadsheet with more than a hundred entries and separate pages of my favorite places to get food, drinks, and things to do in Seattle, complete with columns for price, neighborhood, and personal comments. For fun. And now you get to benefit from it too. For the next few blog posts, I am going to be featuring some of my favorite places in Seattle with pictures to follow. Prepare to drool.
