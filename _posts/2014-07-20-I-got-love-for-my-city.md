Seattle, Washington. The 206. The Rainy City. Coffee Capital of the World.

This is my city.

I love sharing with friends, families, strangers, the best places to eat, drink, and play in Seattle. Sharing the little treasures I've found in Seattle throughout the years as well as finding new places to go is something I really enjoy, and there are a lot of them. How much do I enjoy doing this? Well, I actually take pleasure in writing Yelp reviews and I recently made an extensive Google Spreadsheet with more than a hundred entries of the best places to get food, drinks, and things to do in Seattle, complete with price-range, neighborhood, and personal comments. For fun. And now you get to benefit from it too! For the next few blog posts, I will be featuring some of my favorite places in Seattle with pictures to follow. Prepare to drool.
