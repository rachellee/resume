I think I very well may have found the best sushi in Seattle. A few months ago I bought an Amazon Local deal for a prix fixe meal for two at Sushi Samurai in Queen Anne. It included an appetizer, two rolls, and two large sakes (or beers) for two. The restaurant had good reviews, but I didn't do that much research on it and decided to just trust the 4 stars on Yelp. My mom had just gotten back from a month-long trip, so I wanted to catch up with her and invited her to dinner with me. The interior was cute, small, and nice, but did not hint at all at what was to come.<BR><BR>

First, the waters we got had cucumber and orange slices. Can't go wrong with some infused water. And their chopstick holders were absolutely adorable: little origami cranes. How delightful!<BR><BR>

Now, the best part was the food. We started off with a tempura appetizer. The breading was perfect, portion was great for two people. One thing that made their tempura very unique was their dipping sauce. It had a sweet ginger taste which took the tempura to a whole nother level. Delicious.<BR><BR>

When the sushi came, I was blown away. They had taken so much care with their presentation, adding pieces of fruit, a celery ring, and shredded carrot to the wasabi. The presentation was a perfect lead to the quality and taste of the sushi.<BR><BR>

We ordered the Karen (left) and New Samurai (right) rolls. The Karen roll was composed of seared salmon, fresh salmon, lemon, fried green onion, avocado, cucumber, tempura flakes, and black tobiko (flying fish roe). The New Samurai was composed of snow crab, cucumber and mayo center, topped with
toasted bread crumbs, baked scallop, shrimp, salmon
and samurai sauce. Both were delicious and you really don't need to add any soy sauce to it, unless you do it for the spice (which if you're an addict like me, you will). It was so good we ended up ordering a roll to go for my boyfriend and another roll for ourselves! We ordered the Katana (not pictured) which has salmon, avocado, tobiko, tuna, poke sauce for Kenneth and a Crunchy Salmon (not pictured) for ourselves.<BR><BR>

Not only was the food amazing at Sushi Samurai, but the food was also very reasonably priced and they only serve 100% sustainable sushi!<BR><BR>

If you ever find yourself craving some sushi, you should definitely hit up Sushi Samurai in Queen Anne.
