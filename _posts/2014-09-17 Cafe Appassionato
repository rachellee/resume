title: Cafe Appassionato: the tour, the coffee, the roastery.
---

I took my boyfriend to Cafe Appassionato last week for a date/tour of their roastery (thanks Groupon!) last week and had no idea what to expect. When we got their we were taken to a small conference room and sat around a circular table. I thought I would be interviewed at some point. But Kurt and Adam quickly put us at ease. We chatted a little bit with Kurt, learned a little about what brought him here and his connection to the cafe and then Adam cafe in and the learning commenced. I am a coffee n00b, so I had a lot to learn.

Chemex vs. French Press vs. Aeropress
I learned that there is a big difference between a Chemex and a French Press. A Chemex filters a lot of the sediment and oils, so the coffee will taste smoother, less bold. A French Press, on the other hand, keeps all of the sediment and oil, so the coffee has more flavor, it's more bold. The Aeropress is somewhere inbetween.
