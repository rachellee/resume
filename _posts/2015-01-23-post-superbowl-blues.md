These last couple of weeks have been pretty amazing. The Hawks made an unbelievable comeback against the Packers, scoring 15 points in 44 SECONDS. That's freaking amazing. It was really cool driving around Seattle and seeing the buildings downtown light up in green and blue, some buildings even creating a "12" in their windows. Cars waving 12th Man flags everyone. The city was unified. No one was expecting this game to be easy, but we all had faith. But no one could have guessed that at the 1 yard line that they would be throwing the ball in rather than passing it off to Lynch to run it in. Last night was completely devastating.

So, if you're still needing some decompression or relaxation, you can do what I did last night. It helped. A lot.

First, you can be really pissed about it and talk it our with your significant other for 10-15min. But no more. Otherwise you'll just get more angry. Then it's time for some productive distractions (with Netflix on in the background, of course):
<ul>
	<li>Clean/organize the kitchen</li>
	<li>Water/Repot your plants</li>
	<li>Apply some anti-fungal treatments to your plants (aka Cinnamon)</li>
	<li>Eat chocolate. Preferably Theo's 45% Milk Chocolate with Salted Almonds. It's delicious.</li>
	<li>Watch the sharks' performance during Katy Perry's Teenage Dream. Sometimes you're the right shark, sometimes you're the left shark. C'est la vie.</li>
	<li>Last, but not least, take pride in the fact that this team is the same time that won Seattle its first Superbowl victory and it sure as hell won't be the last.</li>
</ul>

Go Hawks.
