		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am passionate about using research to build extremely reliable, thoughtful, and intuitive products. I have a strong background in research and statistics. I was accepted into the University of Washington Honors Program for Psychology where I built a research study from the ground up, carried it out, and found actionable conclusions as a result of it. I have also taken upper-level statistics courses at UW. Over the past two years I have also been building my technical skills in HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop not only because I enjoy it but also because it makes gives me to ability to interface with front-end developers.<BR><BR>

		I am extremely curious, enthusiastic, and passionate - a creative problem solver, analytical thinker, collaborator, and idea generator.<BR><BR>

		In my spare time I love making Kombucha (it may be hard to believe, but I like it for the taste), practicing & learning more about calligraphy (Copperplate is my favorite), going on hikes and backpacking trips (#northwestisbest), and taking Barre classes (and Barry's Bootcamp when I'm in SF).<BR><BR>

		Want to know more? I would love to chat!<br>
