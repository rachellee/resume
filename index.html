		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am passionate about designing user experiences that you didn't know you wanted. Basing my designs off of research (user, market, competitive), I strive to create a holistic and intuitive experience that is in harmony with the product and the overall brand. In addition to User Experience, I also have a strong background in Psychology, research, and statistics. I was accepted into the University of Washington Honors Program for Psychology where I developed a research study from the ground up, carried it out, and found actionable conclusions as a result of it. I have also taken upper-level statistics courses at UW. Over the past three years I have also been building my technical skills in HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, Illustrator, and Photoshop not only because I enjoy it but also because it makes gives me to ability to interface with front-end developers.<BR><BR>

		I am extremely curious, enthusiastic, and passionate - a creative problem solver, analytical thinker, collaborator, and idea generator.<BR><BR>

		In my spare time I love making Kombucha (it may be hard to believe, but I like it for the taste!), practicing & learning about calligraphy (Copperplate is my favorite), going on hikes and backpacking trips (#northwestisbest), and taking Barre and Barry's Bootcamp classes.<BR><BR>

		Have a problem to solve? I'd love to collaborate.<br>
