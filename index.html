		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>"Good design makes a product understandable." Basing my decisions off of research (user, market, competitive), I strive to create a holistic and intuitive experience that is in harmony with the product and the overall brand. My double degrees in Psychology and Sociology are incredibly helpful in doing this, especially my time in the Honors Program. My junior year, I was accepted into the University of Washington Honors Program for Psychology where I developed my own research study from beginning to end.<BR><BR>

		Over the past three years I have been building my technical skills in HTML5, CSS3, and Responsive Design. Not only because I was curious and enjoy it, but also because it makes gives me to ability to interface with front-end developers.<BR><BR>

		I am extremely curious, enthusiastic, and passionate - a creative problem solver, analytical thinker, collaborator, and idea generator.<BR><BR>

		In my spare time I love making Kombucha (it may be hard to believe, but I like it for the taste!), practicing & learning about calligraphy (Copperplate is my favorite), going on hikes and backpacking trips (#northwestisbest), and taking Barre and Barry's Bootcamp classes.<BR><BR>

		Have a problem to solve? I'd love to collaborate.<br>
