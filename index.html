	<h1>International Travel</h1>
		<p>Italy // February 2011 - June 2011<BR>
			July 2010, I was accepted into UW Sociology's study abroad program to Rome, Italy for Spring Quarter of 2011.  I was in Rome, Italy from February 2011 until June 2011, travelling to Florence, Naples, Pisa, and Assizi while in Italy.  While in Italy, I volunteered at a men's refugee camp and an Italian Elementary school, teaching English.  It was a very unique experience that enriched my life in two very opposite ways.  There were the adorable Italian children who thoroughly enjoyed our inadequacies in knowing the Italian language and loved taking pictures and playing with us.  Then there were the men I met at the refugee center who left their homes in Africa and the Middle East to find solace in Europe, dreaming to someday reach America.

			Barcelona // May 2011<BR>
			While in Italy, a girl friend and I flew to Barcelona for 4 days, living blocks away from La Rambla.  We drank sangria, ate paella and passion fruit for the first time, and had hot chocolate and churros for dessert.  We met and became friends with locals who took us into Parc Gaudi in the moonlight.  In the day, we walked along La Rambla, visited La Sagrada Familia, a Picasso museum as well as the cafe he used to frequent: El Quattre Gats.  At night, we bar hopped and bonded with locals.  By the end of the trip, I had adapted to the Spanish lisp.  It was hard to leave the sunshine, beautiful beaches, kind people, and delicious food.
		</p>
			<BR>
		<p>
			Backpacked to 8 European countries // June 2011<BR>
			3 girl friends and I backpacked to 8 European countries after studying abroad in Rome.  In sequential order, we went to:<BR>
		</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Athens & Santorini, Greece</li>
					<li>Prague, Czech Republic</li>
					<li>Berlin, Germany</li>
					<li>Amsterdam, Netherlands</li>
					<li>Brussels & Bruges, Belgium</li>
					<li>Paris, France</li>
					<li>Dublin, Ireland</li>
					<li>London, England</li>
				</ul>
		<p>
			It was an experience of a lifetime that I hope to do again in Europe, SE Asia, and China.  To put quite shortly, backpacking through Europe has left my desire to travel insatiable.
