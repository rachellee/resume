		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<center><img src="/images/prof.jpg" class="profile_pic"><BR>
			Hello! Nice to e-meet you :)</center><BR>
		<p>My name is Rachel and I love human-centered design.<BR>
			But I didn't realize it until recently.<BR><BR>

			I grew up thinking I would become a doctor (in my case a Pediatrician) or a lawyer (once I realized science wasn't my forte and blood makes me squeamish). At the end of my Sophomore year, I began toying with the idea that maybe I didn't have to do that. Maybe I could do something I was passionate about. So I got my second degree in Psychology. But it still didn't feel right. During my last year at the University of Washington, I began to teach myself how to code again. Through this, I rediscovered my love for design, and I learned about User Experience design, a combination of my two passions: Psychology and Design. This felt right.
			<BR><BR>
			Since then, I have been learning User Experience Design, teaching myself how to use various tools, and enrolling in General Assembly's UX Design course, which I am currently taking.
			<BR><BR>
			I am extremely curious, enthusiastic, and passionate. I revel in analyzing problems, coming up with creative solutions, and collaborating with others to solve them.
			<BR><BR>
			Here is a recommendation one of my clients wrote for me after I designed and built her a site for her business:<BR>
			<blockquote>"Rachel and I connected when a common friend recommended her web dev services for my small business. She is someone who can bring the whole package, visuals and developer wrapped in one. I was looking for a visually compelling website to showcase my products and she surpassed my expectations. She came to our initial meeting with loads of ideas and incorporated my feedback into her design seamlessly. I liked that she involved me in the process just the right amount; not so much that I was deep into the technical details, but enough that I could help decide how I wanted to do things. Rachel was very flexible with her time and ultimately we have a great site to show for it! I definitely recommend her services both as a designer and developer."
			</blockquote>
