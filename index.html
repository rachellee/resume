		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am passionate about building extremely reliable, thoughtful, and intuitive products. I have a strong background in research and statistics. I was accepted into the University of Washington Honors Program for Psychology where I built a research study from the ground up, carried it out, and found actionable conclusions as a result of it. I have also taken several statistics courses at UW. Additionally, over the past two years I have been building my technical skills in HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Design, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop not only because I enjoy it but also because also because it allows me the ability to interface with front-end developers.<BR><BR>

		I am extremely curious, enthusiastic, and passionate - a creative problem solver, analytical thinker, collaborator, and idea generator.<BR><BR>

		Want to know more? I would love to hear from you!<br>
