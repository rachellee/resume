		<h1>International Travel</h1>
			<p>Italy // February 2011 - June 2011<BR>
				July 2010, I was accepted into UW Sociology's study abroad program for Spring Quarter of 2011. I was in Rome, Italy from February 2011 until June 2011, travelling to Florence, Naples, Pisa, and Assizi while in Italy.  While in Italy, I volunteered at a men's refugee camp and an Italian Elementary school, teaching English.  It was a very unique experience that enriched my life in two very opposite ways.  There were the adorable Italian children who thoroughly enjoyed our inadequacies in knowing the Italian language and loved taking pictures and playing with us.  Then there were the men I met at the refugee center who left their homes in Africa and the Middle East to find solace in Europe, dreaming to someday reach America.
			</p>
				<BR>
			<p>
				Barcelona // May 2011<BR>
				While in Italy, a girl friend and I flew to Barcelona for 4 days, living blocks away from La Rambla.  We drank sangria, ate paella and passion fruit for the first time, and had hot chocolate and churros for dessert.  We met and became friends with locals who took us into Parc Gaudi in the moonlight.  In the day, we walked along La Rambla, visited La Sagrada Familia, a Picasso museum as well as the cafe he used to frequent: El Quattre Gats.  At night, we bar hopped and bonded with locals.  By the end of the trip, I had adapted to the Spanish lisp.  It was hard to leave the sunshine, beautiful beaches, kind people, and delicious food.
			</p>
				<BR>
			<p>
				Backpacked to 8 European countries // June 2011<BR>
				3 girl friends and I backpacked to 8 European countries after studying abroad in Rome.  In sequential order, we went to:<BR>
			</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Athens & Santorini, Greece</li>
						<li>Prague, Czech Republic</li>
						<li>Berlin, Germany</li>
						<li>Amsterdam, Netherlands</li>
						<li>Brussels & Bruges, Belgium</li>
						<li>Paris, France</li>
						<li>Dublin, Ireland</li>
						<li>London, England</li>
					</ul>
			<p>
				It was an experience of a lifetime that I hope to do again in Europe, SE Asia, and China.  To put quite shortly, backpacking through Europe has left my desire to travel insatiable.
			</p>
				<br>
			<p>
				Taiwan // since 1994<BR>
				My grandparents, both maternal and paternal, escaped to Taiwan when the Cultural Revolution was in its infancy in China and have been there ever since. My parents and all of my extended family were born and raised in Taiwan - my father from Taipei and my mother from Kaohsiung. The majority of my family still live in Taiwan, so I have travelled there every few years since I was a young girl. My journey to Taiwan is always very meaningful since the majority of my exposure to my ancestry and culture comes from those week long trips. It is a large part of who I am and who I am proud to be. 
			</p>
				<BR>
			<p>
				Singapore // May 2012<BR>
				I was lucky to have the chance to visit Singapore because we have some family friends who live there. Fun fact: by using implementing land reclamation, Singapore turned swamp and ocean into land for their main airport, Changi Airport. The whole city of Singapore looks like a futuristic art installation. In the downtown area, there are LED lights and fun art installations on almost every city block. Many of the buildings are built in a way you've never seen before, like the <a href="www.marinabaysands.com/">Marina Bay Sands resort</a>. It was quite a delight to revel in futurustic ideals - a digression from my nostalgic vintage ways.
