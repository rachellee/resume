Basing my decisions off of research, I strive to create a holistic and intuitive experience that is in harmony with the product and the overall brand. My double degrees in Psychology and Sociology are incredibly helpful in doing this, as well as my time in the UW's Honors Program.<BR><BR>

		Over the past three years I have been building my technical skills in HTML5, CSS3, and Responsive Design. Not only because I was curious and found that I enjoy it, but also because it makes gives me to ability to interface with front-end developers.<BR><BR>

		Over the last year, I have been learning User Experience Design, teaching myself how to use various tools and enrolling in General Assembly's UX Design course, which I am currently taking.

		I am extremely curious, enthusiastic, and passionate - a creative problem solver, analytical thinker, collaborator, and idea generator.<BR><BR>

		In my spare time I love making Kombucha (it may be hard to believe, but I like it for the taste!), practicing & learning  calligraphy, going on hikes and backpacking trips (#northwestisbest), and taking Barre and Barry's Bootcamp classes.<BR><BR>

		Have a problem to solve? I'd love to collaborate! <a target="_blank" href="mailto: hello@rachellee.io">hello@rachellee.io</a>
