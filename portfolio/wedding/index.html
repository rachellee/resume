		I worked with a client in San Francisco to design all the signs menu, program, and games for their wedding in Los Angeles. For the main signs, they wanted a glamorous, romantic feel to them. For the other signs, they wanted them to be a little more fun. For the table numbers instead of having numbers, they wanted it to be more personal, so they instead chose their favorite restaurants and I found maps and I added a heart where the restaurant is located. Here is a small sample out of the 85 signs & games that I made.<BR><BR>

		This is the wedding menu that I designed. "Xi" was used on the wedding invitations and I thought that it would be nice to include it on the menu and programs as well for some cohesion.<BR><center><a href="/images/wedding/menu.jpg"><img src="/images/wedding/menu_s.jpeg" class="small_project_photo" alt="Wedding Signage"></a><BR>(click to see the whole menu)</center><BR><BR>
	
		The majority of the signs was designed using this flourish. I think it really brought to life the romanticism my clients wanted without being over-the-top, but still being glamorous.<BR>

		These table signs were a lot of fun to make. The trick of making these were the spacing and placement of the restaurant names in relation to the maps. Making them easy to read, visually intriguing, and cohesive was tricky, but I think I was successful in doing so!<BR>

		This was one of the favorite signs I made. I got to deviate from the other designs and have a little fun with it. I wanted to make a sign that was fun and cute. Since this wedding was held at a venue next to the ocean and during the spring, I wanted to make use of sweet, pastel colors that would still match the colors of the wedding. I paid close attention to the size of the text, spacing, margins, and placement of the image.<BR>
