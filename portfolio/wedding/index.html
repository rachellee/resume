		I worked with a client in San Francisco to design all the signs menu, program, and games for their wedding in Los Angeles. For the main signs, they wanted a glamourous, romantic feel to them. For the other signs, they wanted them to be a little more fun. For the table numbers instead of having numbers, they wanted it to be more personal, so they instead chose their favorite restaurants and I found maps and I added a heart where the restaurant is located.

		Here is a small sample out of the 85 signs & games that I made.
