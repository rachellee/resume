		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		For this challenge, we were asked, "How might we use technology to inspire all socioeconomic and multicultural groups to lead healthier lives?" with a focus on Hispanic culture. See the full brief <a href="https://openideo.com/challenge/healthy-lives/brief">here.</a><BR><BR>

		I met up with a girl I met through LinkedIn when I was research GA's UX course at the most delightful dessert place in the Mission and we worked together using the Design Studio method. We did 7min of brainstorming, followed by a discussion, followed by 5min of refinement. This was after Charlene and I had dessert, of course ;)

		Here we are. Hello from <a href="http://sixthcourse.com/">Sixth Course</a>!<BR><BR>

		<h1>Research</h1>
		Due to the time constraints of this project - only 14 hours to get it submitted during the Idea phase - rapid braistorming was done before research and the research done prior to submission was ethnographical research at a local Mexican grocery. (see the 3rd paragraph of Solutions)<BR><BR>

		<h1>Solutions</h1>
		When I first thought about this problem, I thought about ideas like an app that families can use to collaborate to pick menus together, my grandmother's kitchen and digitizing her recipes, my grandmother's knowledge on edible plants and Eastern medicine and how to share that, learning about traditional recipes from different regions, and having the ability to watch grandma cook and hear her instructions.<BR><BR>

		Right before the refinement phase, we found that we could implement the technologies of virtual reality (VR) and this really opened up my imagination. Once the world of VR develops to the point where it's affordable, how great would it be if your grandmother could have a pair where they push a button and can record everything while they're cooking and include their verbal instructions? Then you on the other side could put on your VR glasses, watch everything, cook while you're watching, and ask her questions while you do it. Or while she's walking around, she could tell you, "oh, this is Rosemary! You can use this in x, y, z." Or, while she's at the market, she could tell you what things are and how to cook with them. Or even better you could walk around the market with her, ask her what things are and she could tell you in real time!<BR><BR>

		After this, Charlene and I looked up a local, family-owned Hispanic grocery store, Mi Tierra, to observe how people shopped, what was in the store, and how it was organized. What I found was that the produce section inside the store was very small; it was mostly outside of the store on stands. However, there was no fresh meats or seafoods. Inside the store it was mostly prepackaged foods. I also noticed that the produce inside wasn't labeled with names - only prices. I had no idea what some of the items were!

		When I got home, I opened up a coconut and worked more on my project. I had several options I wanted to puruse, but the one that resonated with me the most, due to my vist to the grocery store, was one that would not only teach you what mysterious produce in your favorite grocery store is, but also how to cook with it and how to cook traditional recipes that your grandmother (or someone else's grandmother!) would make.<BR><BR>

		My first iteration included image recognition in it. You would hold up your phone to the item, flags would pop up with names and you would tap the flag to get more information such as what culture uses it most often, traditional recipes. I also wanted a feature that would allow you to explore traditional recipes around the world. These are my initial sketches:<BR>

		var _cpmp = _cpmp || []; _cpmp.push(cpo);
		(function() { var cp = document.createElement("script"); cp.type = "text/javascript";
		cp.async = true; cp.src = "//www.cincopa.com/media-platform/runtime/libasync.js";
		var c = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
		c.parentNode.insertBefore(cp, c); })(); </script><noscript>Powered by Cincopa <a href='http://www.cincopa.com/video-hosting'>Video Hosting for Business</a> solution.</noscript>

		Here are a couple of wireframes I did for the two features:<BR>

		</center><BR><BR>

		After some collaboration with other people on OpenIdeo during the Refinement phase, I proceeded to do my 2nd iteration. The technologies of image recognition are not quite refined yet, so I changed the feature to three options: name, photo, or verbal. These open the doors for learning in 3 situations: when you have the name of the produce, if you don't have a name, and when you don't speak the language.
		Here are my wireframes:<BR><BR>
