		It's been crazy busy with bachelorette parties, going away parties, and wedding shenanigans, so sorry for the delay! Over the next few days I will be working on doing name tags and place cards for my friend for her wedding! I started out using my Sakura pens, but they didn't quite look nice enough, so I used my calligraphy nibs and with Indian Ink. Here is my favorite from today:<BR>

		Here is about a fifth of the tags I have made! It was slightly terrifying arranging them so that they don't smudge.<BR>

		Getting down to crunch time... I have definitely improved my lettering skills (in this style) from the beginning until now. I was was able to freehand these two with no problem! They look pretty good in my opinion :) <BR>

		I felt like doing something a little more whimsical today. Not my favorite, but it was entertaining to do.<BR>
