		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		This is a work in progress of my final project for my User Experience Design course at General Assembly. For our final project we are asked to "examine a problem space and design solutions for it based on what we learn in class." By the end of the class I will have produced full UX documentation.<BR><BR>

		For this project, I'm attempting to make trip planning and coordinating with friends easier, more fun, and more streamlined. We all love going on trips with our friends, but planning it can be a logistical nightmare. The solution is TripBuddy (still working on a name, ha). A one-stop-shop for everything you need to plan a trip with friends.<BR><BR>

		This was a problem I've been thinking about for a while now, but it's even more of a challenge now that I've moved away from all my friends. I recently moved to San Francisco from Seattle and have been trying to plan a trip with friends. It is even more difficult now that everyone is either working or in graduate school to figure out everyone's schedules and who can do what and when. And because it's so difficult and people are slow to respond because it takes so long to type out every date, we have had to put off planning. This is my solution to that problem. It will help bring friends together and help create lasting memories by making trip planning and coordination easy.<BR><BR>

		<h1>Research</h1>
		I conducted four interviews with a range of demographics in order to create my personas for this project. Some of the key findings I found from the interviews were how many different applications people were using to plan a single 4-7 day trip and how many different intricate solutions they created for themselves and for the group. My interviewees use up to 5 different apps to plan a single trip, which is crazy. Also, My interviewees ranged in tolerance for long-form. Some of my interviewees despised having to read through comments sections of Facebook events to find information they needed, whereas some preferred or had neutral feelings for using email to communicate plans with people. However, the more people there are involved in a trip, the more likely there will be a select few who plan the trip and just send out an invite. Whoever can come can come and those who can't, can't.<BR><BR>
		The following are my four personas. Feel free to click through and get to know them :)

		<h1>Solutions</h1>
		Based on my personas, I came up with several main features that my interviewees all brought up: checklists, calendar coordination, distributing responsibilities, and payment request and the ability to pay others. I also included some secondary features that my interviewees discussed: ride coordination, voting on locations, and chat.

		The way I think about a problem is to first write out every feature that I want to include. Then I map out the site using taxonomy. This is actually a process I have done since I've started building websites, not knowing that it was User Experience Design! I do this before I even begin sketching, which may seem a little out of order, but I use this as a way to organize my thoughts. Literally.<BR><BR>

		Then, I sketch. Here are my sketches and wireframe sketches:<BR>

		Based on the survey I tagged on to the end of my card sorting activity I created using <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com">Optimal Workshop's Optimal Sort</a>, I found that 50% of my participants would not use a chat, which I found to be very interesting. I also found that people had many varying ways of deciding what was main content, supporting content, and interface content. My conclusion is that I will need to follow up with these individuals and ask them how they made their decisions and base my third round of iterations and prototype off that information. In addition to my card sorting activity, I also included a post-sort survey. An interesting finding was that only 50% of people would use a chat feature, so I would like to do more research before including that feature. <BR><BR>
