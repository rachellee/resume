		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		This project was done as my final project for General Assembly's UX Design course. Even when planning a 2-day weekend camping trip, people use several different apps to coordinate rides, divvy up responsibilities, and figure out who's going. This challenge applies also to domestic  trips, international trips, road trips, and more.<BR><BR>

		In an effort to make trip planning and coordination with friends easier, more fun, and more efficient, I created Lively. A one-stop-shop for everything you need to plan a trip with friends.<BR><BR>

		<h1>Research</h1>

		<h2>Interviews</h2>
		My target demographic is people between the ages of 18 and 32. These are the people who go to overnight music festivals, Burning Man, weekend camping trips, and domestic or international getaways with friends. They are generally more tech savvy and more likely to use apps.<BR><BR>
		I conducted four in-person interviews and discovered these key findings:<BR><BR>
			<ul>
				<li>People were using up to 7 different apps to plan a single trip</li>
				<li>Disdain for long-form</li>
				<li>There is no app available for coordinating dates available with friends</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h2>Personas</h2>
		Here are the four personas based on my interviews. Feel free to click through and get to know them.

		<h2>Card Sort and Survey</h2>
		I also performed a card sort with several individuals to see how they would organize the content. Included with the card sort activity was also a survey asking several questions, one of which asking about whether a Chat feature would be useful. Less than 50% answered yes, so I decided to not include it.
		<BR><BR>
		<h2>Prototype</h2>
		Using Sketch 3 and Invision, I built a working prototype. Having people test the app gave me a great deal of insight into how to better organize information and improve usability.
