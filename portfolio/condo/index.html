		While in Seattle, in addition to doing freelance work I also worked as the operations manager for a small family-owned property management firm. One of the condos had a very... interesting style. This is how it looked before the remodel:<BR>

		It was very beige, which was made even worse with a red accent wall... the style was almost a little goth. Since this unit is on the 14th floor, it has unobstructed sunlight and is a very bright unit. I believed that if given a proper update, it would increase its desire to potential tenants and rented out at a higher rate than it was.<BR><BR>

		I wanted to optimize on the brightness of the unit and match it with a light, bright, and airy look. I really love the minimal, clean look and contrasting it with pops of color, to give it more life. I worked with a budget of $300, including all the paint. Since finishing the remodel, the number of inquiries on this unit has increased exponentially, becoming one of the most inquired upon condos owned by the firm. It is now one of the most popular units.
