		This is a project I worked on for a Design Strategy internship application for McKinsey in 2014.<BR><BR>

		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		I was asked to "help a major healthcare provider reimagine how they deliver healthcare services to patients. They are interested in transforming their business model from being treatment focused (expensive to provide) to being health and wellness focused (better for patients). This includes digitally enabling existing services such as finding a doctor, appointment scheduling, prescription management, etc."<BR><BR>

		My mission was to "assume that the digitally delivered services will be delivered via a smartphone app. What information would I want and how would I go about getting it? What activities would I propose? What artifacts would I provide to my client? Spending no more than 2 hours on this exercise."<BR><BR>

		<h1>Research</h1>
		I thought about what information I was missing and what information I would need in order to proceed. I felt that I suitable user research method would be surveys. I would want to know things like<BR><BR>

		<ul>
			<li>What features would people like and what would they most likely use?</li>
			<li>What times of day do the go on their phone and what are they doing? What do they use their phones for?</li>
			<li>How/if people keep track of health (exercise, weight, insulin, blood pressure, sugar levels)</li>
			<li>Travel a lot? How do they get their medication when they are travelling?</li>
		</ul>
		I would also want to get information from the healthcare provider such as age, gender, race, socioeconomic status of clients. Acquiring this information complies under HIPAA, so it should be ok. This would give me information into<BR><BR>
		
		<ul>
			<li>If I will need the ability to change the language of the app?</li>
			<li>If the target users are tech savvy?</li>
			<li>Will I need a function to change text size?</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Proposed activities</b><BR>
		People would probably feel uncomfortable if approached in the waiting room. Instead, I would have doctors ask patients at the end of their appointments if they would be interested in helping them build a smartphone app. If so, give them the short survey where they could also indicate if they would like to be a participant in a focus group. If they participate in the focus group they get a $25 gift card. During the focus group they would interact with the wireframes.<BR><BR>

		<b>Artifacts for client</b><BR>
		Before meeting with the client I would make sure that I had evidence backing up design choices. I would have several personas. I would have done user research on features, navigation and information architecture, content strategy (language, accessbility, etc.). I would also have performed A/B testing to determine the best design and flow of the app. I would also have created interactive wireframes that have gone through user testing so that the client could interact with something close to the real deal.<BR><BR>

		<h1>Solutions</h1>
		Since this was a product for a "major healthcare provider," I would have to make it an app that would be desireable to use for all ages (well, at least 16 and up). I knew that my app had to include at least those they had listed: finding a doctor, appointment scheduling, prescription management. Another feature that immediately popped into my head was a reminder system. Many of my friends and family members (myself as well!) have a difficult time with taking medications on time and knowing how many they had taken that day and also keeping track of doctor appointments. No one likes setting additional alarms or cluttering up their calendar with medication events. So a feature I wanted to include in this app was reminders. Users would enter the name of the medication, tell the app the number of times a day they need to take the medication, days of the week, times of the day, and the app would send push notifications to them.<BR><BR>

		Another situation many people encounter is that they start experiencing a symptom or they experience pain (in a minor way). Wouldn't it be nice to be able to quickly and easily being able to communicate with your PCP? 50% of people have looked online for health info and 33% have self-diagnosed in 2014 (<a href="http://www.imshealth.com/portal/site/imshealth/menuitem.762a961826aad98f53c753c71ad8c22a/?vgnextoid=e0f913850c8b1410VgnVCM10000076192ca2RCRD" target="_blank">IMS Health, 2013</a>). It would be nice to be able to ask your doctor (or someone from their office), someone who knows you and your medical history, instead. This would help shift the balance from treatment to health and wellness. An issue I do forsee from the provider side is that they could possibly become inundated with messages. It may be necessary to add an extra step or two, like having the user enter their password again, before sending a message.<BR><BR>

		For the search function I thought about traveling. The average age of leisure travelers is 47.5 years old and 79% of leisure trips are done by car (<a href="https://www.ustravel.org/news/press-kit/travel-facts-and-statistics" target="_blank">U.S. Travel Association, 2012</a>). Packing and making sure all your ducks are in a row before you leave home can already be stressful. It would be even more stressful to have to make sure you have gotten prescriptions refills and that you have enough medication to last your trip. What if the app saved your insurance information and your preferred pharmacy so that you could find a pharmacy and pick up your medication whereever you were? Or find the nearest doctor that is covered by your plan? Planning and preparing for a trip can already be stressful enough. It'd be nice to take some of that stress away and instead give the user flexibility, efficiency, and convenience.<BR><BR>

		I thoroughly enjoyed applying for the Design Strategy role as I got to solve a problem and get creative with it. I would like to thank McKinsey Digital Labs for the opportunity and Courtney for taking time out of her busy schedule to chat with me. I would also like to thank <a href="http://adamwhitcroft.com/wirekit/" target="_blank">Adam Whitcroft</a> for his wireframe kit and <a href="http://www.flaticon.com/packs/fitness-forever" target="_blank">Flaticon</a> for all their awesome, free icons.
