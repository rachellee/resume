		This is a project I worked on for a client who was starting her own business and needed a website.<BR><BR>

		First, looking at her original site, I looked at the links and the information given and determined the best way to present it in an intuitive manner. Then, I determined the persona of someone who would be interested in her product and concluded it would be a dog owner in their 20s-40s, who is interested in environmentally-friendly products, and enjoys taking their dog on runs, to the dog park, and on outdoor romps. Based on this persona and the product itself I created 3 iterations for her using three different colors: forest green, textured beige, and this one. This was her favorite. I then built a responsive website that looks as wonderful on mobile as it does on desktop. In order to allow for seamless integration with Etsy, she asked me to incorporate the Etsy Widget, which unfortunately is not responsive, but it is the best way for customers to make a purchase with fewer clicks. To add a little bit of delight, I renamed the bags to dog-breed related names such as "Greyhound" for grey, "Purpillon" for purple, and "Red Rover" for red.<BR><BR>

		In addition to the website, I also did a photoshoot for her at Greenlake and a nearby dog park to capture some photos with the doggy bags in action and designed a business card for her.<BR><BR>
 
		She makes dog bag holders that fits any type/size of bags and can attach to the leash. It was an invention born out of necessity and it's the most durable dog bag holder out there, while being fun and whimsical with many different color combinations. She's been working on this for the past two years (in addition to school and work) and has done a ton of r&d on. Check out her product <a href="http://www.doodogs.com">here</a>!
