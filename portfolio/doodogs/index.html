		This is a project I worked on for a client who was starting her own business and needed a website that featured her product, gave information on it, and also had a way of purchasing it. I worked on this in 2014 before any formal education in UX design strategies and protocol. I built the website myself in HTML5, CSS, and PHP. PHP because we were originally going to do a Wordpress.org site.<BR><BR>

		First, looking at her original site, my immediate impression was the lack of intuitiveness in her information architecture. The home page had information about the product, but then there was another link for product information that had information that wasn't on the home page. The links to purchase her product were buried. The colors were bland. There was no information about her. And the dog in the title looked a little crazy (see below).<BR><BR>

		First, I looked at the links and the information given and determined the best way to present it in an intuitive manner. Since this was a very new product, I thought it would be a good idea to include information about the product on the front page. Inspired by <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square's</a> website, I wanted to include the small icons with bits of information under them.

		Then, I did a basic persona of who would be most interested in her product and thought it would be a dog owner in their 20s-40s, who is interested in environmentally-friendly products, and enjoys taking their dog on runs, to the dog park, and on outdoor romps.

		The first iteration I did was too basic. The section on sustaiability was also pushed down too low when it should be a highlight of the product. The us vs. them section was also too text heavy.<BR><BR>

		The second and third iterations were too image heavy. Although it was cute and the colors were very complementary, my client wanted the information to be above the fold of the website. And that couldn't happen unless I nixed the images.<BR><BR>

		The end result was what the website is now. With all the information on the product above the fold along with "Available Now," which prompts the user to continue down.<BR><BR>

		I then built my client a responsive website that looks as wonderful on mobile as it does on desktop. In order to allow for seamless integration with Etsy, she asked me to incorporate the Etsy Widget, which unfortunately is not responsive, but it is the best way for customers to make a purchase with fewer clicks. To add a little bit of delight, I renamed the bags to dog-breed related names such as "Greyhound" for grey, "Purpillon" for purple, and "Red Rover" for red.<BR><BR>

		In addition to the website, I also did a photoshoot for her at Greenlake and a nearby dog park to capture some photos with the doggy bags in action and designed a business card for her.<BR><BR>
 
		She makes dog bag holders that fits any type/size of bags and can attach to the leash. It was an invention born out of necessity and it's the most durable dog bag holder out there, while being fun and whimsical with many different color combinations. She's been working on this for the past two years (in addition to school and work) and has done an incredible amount of r&d on. Check out her product <a href="http://www.doodogs.com">here</a>!
