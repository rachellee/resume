		This is a project I worked on for a client who was starting her own business and needed a website. I created 3 iterations for her and this was her favorite. I then built a responsive website that looks as wonderful on mobile as it does on desktop.<BR><BR>
 
		She makes dog bag holders that fits any type/size of bags and can attach to the leash. It was an invention born out of necessity and it's the most durable dog bag holder out there and it's super cute :) She's been working on this for the past two years (in addition to school and work) and has done a ton of r&d on. Check out her product <a href="http://www.doodogs.com">here</a>!
