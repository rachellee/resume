		This is a website I designed and built for a client who wanted a clean, minimal, and beautiful launch site for an iPhone app he was building. Using Git, HTML5, CSS3, and Rails.<BR><BR>

		In the beginning, I was doing a vertically stacked design. However, since the site is so minimal, I decided to go with a 3-column design that would collapse down to vertical display for tablets and smartphones.<BR><BR>
