		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		My client wanted a clean, minimal, and informative but succinct launch site for an iPhone app he was building. I worked on this in 2014 before any formal education in UX design strategies and protocol. I built the website myself in HTML5, CSS, and Rails.<BR><BR>
		
		<h1>Research</h1>
		I looked at various app sites to determine the information and layout of the site.<BR><BR>
		
		<h1>Solutions</h1>
		In the beginning, I was doing a one column design even for the desktop app. However, since the site is so minimal, I decided to go with a 3-column design that would collapse down to vertical display for tablets and smartphones.<BR><BR>

		<h1>Tools Used</h1>
		The tools I used for this project was Adobe Photoshop, pen & paper, Git, HTML5, CSS3, and Rails.<BR><BR>
